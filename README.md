MongoDB, Spotify API, Auth0, HPCC Systems, NumPy, pickle, Docker

Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them:
We attempted to utilize HPCC System's landing zone to access large datasets and manipulate them without having 
to store them locally, but finding an IP of the individual machine where the files were sprayed was difficult. 
We also ran into many compilation issues which included Python virtual environment conflicts and missing npm
dependencies.

React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MongoDB
